Takes the joint.yaml file and splits its entries out into the
individual conference files unders venues/. This is part of the
process of separating out joint events (where a particular volume
properly belongs to multiple venues) from colocated events (that
have separate proceedings but happen to have taken place at
the same time, e.g., workshops attached to a conference).
