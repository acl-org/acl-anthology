A venue in the ACL Anthology is a conference, workshop, journal, or other publication series that regularly publishes papers. The central volumes in the ACL are the following:

* Conferences: [ACL](https://aclanthology.org/venues/acl/), [AACL](https://aclanthology.org/venues/aacl/), [EMNLP](https://aclanthology.org/venues/emnlp/), [NAACL](https://aclanthology.org/venues/naacl/), [EACL](https://aclanthology.org/venues/eacl/), and [CoNLL](https://aclanthology.org/venues/conll/)
* Journals: [CL](https://aclanthology.org/venues/cl/) and [TACL](https://aclanthology.org/venues/tacl/)

We also host volumes for many other venues. Some major venues we host include [COLING](https://aclanthology.org/venues/coling/), [LREC](https://aclanthology.org/venues/lrec/), [IJCNLP](https://aclanthology.org/venues/ijcnlp/), [*SEM](https://aclanthology.org/venues/starsem/), [WMT](https://aclanthology.org/venues/wmt/), [SemEval](https://aclanthology.org/venues/semeval/), and many more.

We are happy to ingest and host material for new venues. We generally accept proceedings subject to the following conditions:

* The venue publishes papers in the fields of computational linguistics or speech and and natural language processing, broadly defined.
* The venue has high standards, which generally means that it is peer-reviewed by experts in the field.
* The venue organizers either sign over paper copyrights to the ACL (preferred), or sign an agreement allowing us to share the papers under a Creative Commons [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

If you wish for the Anthology to host your proceedings, please contact the Anthology director.
