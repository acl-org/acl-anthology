An [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org) is a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes you from other researchers and links your research outputs and activities to your identity.
When these iDs are present on ingested papers, it removes the ambiguity that sometimes arises with popular names and name variants.

We urge every author who is actively publishing papers to create an ORCID iD and to <mark>supply this ID to publication systems such as [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/)[^1] and [Softconf](https://softconf.com/)[^2]</mark>. Although the Anthology currently only uses the iD itself for grouping papers, adding the following information to your profile is helpful in situations where we manually disambiguate authors, and may be used later for automated matching.

[^1]: Visit the [edit page link at OpenReview](https://openreview.net/profile/edit) and add your ORCID iD under the "Personal Links" section.

[^2]: Visit [the global profile](https://www.softconf.com/naacl2021/super/scmd.cgi?ucmd=updateProfile) by accessing any conference, clicking your name in the upper right, selecting the "Update Profile" link, and navigating down to the "Additional Information for Authors and Reviewers" section.

- **Add name variants**: In your ORCID iD profile, you can set your given and family names, your published name, and any name variants you have published under (e.g., with or without middle initials, maiden names, etc.). It is especially important to make sure you have at least one Latin variant of your name. ([This profile](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1831-3457) is a good example.)
- **Make sure your name is visible**: We have encountered situations where an individual's name was private.
- **Register at least one personal email address**: This can be kept private, but ensures permanent access so that you can update your ORCID record in the future.

In addition, the following information can help us improve matching, should we need to manually disambiguate authors.

- **Add a few representative publications**: You can add your publications to your ORCID iD profile. This is less important for matching in the Anthology, but it is a good practice to keep your ORCID iD profile complete. Many Anthology papers have DOIs, which simplifies the process.
- **Add educational history and affiliations**: Adding your educational background and current affiliations can help further distinguish you from other researchers with similar names. It is especially helpful for us to know the institution from which you receive (or expect to receive) your highest degree, since we use this information when disambiguating authors.

In addition to this, make sure that the name you enter into submission mangagement systems (such as Softconf or OpenReview) matches one of the ORCID variants, ideally the published name.
