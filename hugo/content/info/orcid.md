An [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org) is a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes you from other researchers and links your research outputs and activities to your identity.
When these iDs are present on ingested papers, it removes the ambiguity that sometimes arises with popular names and name variants.

We urge every author who is actively publishing papers to create an ORCID iD, and to supply this ID to publication systems such as OpenReview.[^1] In creating or editing your ORCID iD profile, please consider the following tips to help match your papers to your Anthology page:

[^1]: Visit the [edit page link at OpenReview](https://openreview.net/profile/edit) and add your ORCID iD under the "Personal Links" section.

- **Add name variants**: This is most important. In your ORCID iD profile, you can set your given and family names, your published name, and any name variants you have published under (e.g., with or without middle initials, maiden names, etc.). https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1831-3457 is a good example. Make sure you have at least one Latin variant of your name. This helps the Anthology match your publications even if they are listed under different names.
- **Make sure your name is visible**: Ensure that your name is set to be visible to everyone in your ORCID iD profile settings. If your name is private, the Anthology may not be able to access it for matching.
- **Register at least one personal email address**: This can be kept private but ensures permanent access so that you can update your ORCID record in the future.

In addition, the following information can help us improve matching, should we need to manually disambiguate authors.

- **Add a few representative publications**: You can add your publications to your ORCID iD profile. This is less important for matching in the Anthology, but it is a good practice to keep your ORCID iD profile complete. Many Anthology papers have DOIs, which simplifies the process.
- **Add educational history and affiliations**: Adding your educational background and current affiliations can help further distinguish you from other researchers with similar names. It is especially helpful for us to know the institution from which you receive (or expect to receive) your highest degree, since we use this information when disambiguating authors.

In addition to this, make sure that the name you enter into submission mangagement systems (such as Softconf or OpenReview) matches one of the ORCID variants, ideally the published name.
