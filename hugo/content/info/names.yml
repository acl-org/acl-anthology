Stub: This page should describe how the Anthology deals with names, including:
- PDF metadata and the formation of name slugs
- Creating author pages
- Disambiguating names and merging name variants
- How papers are matched to authors

It can and should refer to other documentation spread around, but this could be a piece of central information.
