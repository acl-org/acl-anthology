Title: Help Shape the ACL Anthology!

The ACL Anthology is a treasure. It is the repository of our community's
scientific contributions extending back over fifty years; its engine is nicely
designed custom in-house software that still works well after almost two
decades; and it has enabled research projects examining topics like author
networks and topic shift over time. That all of this labor has been donated by
its members further distinguishes the Anthology: it is not a found treasure, but
one that has been crafted and shaped over countless hours, as if by a hundred
Berninis, holding keyboards instead of chisels.

Over the next few years, we plan a focused effort to build on this remarkable
achievement. To do this, we need **your help**, in the form of ***project
leads*** and ***issue-based contributions*** to tasks in those projects. We have
a number of [short-term
projects](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/projects) related to
Anthology operations, and also ideas with longer time horizons that require
input, shaping, and direction. In one of the project lead roles, you would have
the opportunity to contribute to a substantial piece of the Anthology's
operations and future course.

+ **Anthology Publication Lead:** Assist with the ingestion of conference
  proceedings and liaison with Softconf to improve and simplify the process
  (Apr/2019).
+ **Anthology Search & API Lead:** Address [issues with third-party search
  engines](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/projects/6) (Apr/2019).
  Help with the design and building of a custom Anthology-hosted search engine
  based on [bibsearch](https://github.com/mjpost/bibsearch) (open-ended).
+ **Anthology Data Lead:** Help ensure the [integrity of existing and future
  data](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/projects/5) in the Anthology
  (Dec/2019).
+ **Anthology Aesthetics Lead:** Improve the visual display of the Anthology on
  the web (Dec/2019).

These roles will be selected by the Director and persist as long or as short as
you like.

If you do not have the interest or time to take on a leadership role, but are
still interested in contributing, we are also looking for occasional
contributors. People in such roles will work with Leads and the Director to
dispatch [issues on our GitHub
page](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/issues) (which are often pieces
of larger projects). Examples include:

+ Investigate tools we might use for static site generation and write a small
  report.
+ Write a Python script to convert the Anthology's authoritative XML to a YAML
  database.
+ Help crowdsource a list of name spelling variations so we can build
  consolidated author pages.
+ Identify terms (ideally automatically) that should be protected for title
  casing, and issue a pull request.
+ Handle [individual requests for
  corrections](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acorrection)
  (simple edits to authoritative XML)
