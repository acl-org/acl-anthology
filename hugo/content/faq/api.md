Title: How can I programmatically access the Anthology's data?
weight: 7
---

The Anthology's data is hosted in our Github repo, which contains all the metadata for all its papers and their authors, the volumes those papers are organized into, and the real-world events that presented those volumes.
The PDFs are hosted on our servers.
All of this data is accessible via [the ACL Anthology Python module on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/acl-anthology/), which you can install with pip:

```bash
pip install acl-anthology
```

Please see our [developer documentation]({{<relref "/info/development.md" >}}) for more information.
