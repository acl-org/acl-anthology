Title: Where can I get Anthology citation files?
weight: 1
---

The Anthology provides a number of citation formats.
Our main supported format is BibTeX, and we also provide MODS XML and Endnote formats.
All of these formats can be downloaded from individual paper pages by clicking on the "Cite" button in each paper's upper-righthand corner.
We also provide convenient buttons for copying individual citation formats to the clipboard.
In addition, we provided formatted citation strings, both in official ACL format and an "informal" format; these can be useful, for example, for use in a WSIWYG editor.

Users of the Anthology may also be interested in our bulk BibTeX citation files:
* [anthology+abstracts.bib.gz](https://aclanthology.org/anthology.bib) contains citations for all papers that exist in the Anthology, including abstracts.
* [anthology.bib.gz](https://aclanthology.org/anthology.bib.gz) contains all citations but remove abstracts, to save on space.
* [anthology.bib](https://aclanthology.org/anthology.bib) contains all citations without abstracts, and is suitable for direct import into Overleaf repositories.
