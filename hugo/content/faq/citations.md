Title: Where can I get Anthology citation files?

---

The Anthology's main supported format is BibTeX, but we also provide [MODS XML](https://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/) and Endnote formats.
These formats can be downloaded both in bulk and from individual paper pages.

Individual paper citations can be downloaded from each paper page by clicking on the "Cite" button in each paper's upper-righthand corner.
We also provide convenient buttons for copying individual citation formats to the clipboard.
In addition, we provided formatted citation strings, both in official ACL format and an "informal" format; these can be useful, for example, for use in a WSIWYG editor.

Our bulk downloads are available for BibTeX export formats from the following files:

* [anthology+abstracts.bib.gz](https://aclanthology.org/anthology.bib) contains citations for all papers that exist in the Anthology, including abstracts.
* [anthology.bib.gz](https://aclanthology.org/anthology.bib.gz) contains all citations but remove abstracts, to save on space.
* [anthology.bib](https://aclanthology.org/anthology.bib) contains all citations without abstracts, and is suitable for direct import into Overleaf repositories.

Finally, we also offer [an XML paper feed](https://aclanthology.org/papers/index.xml), which is useful in tools like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/).
