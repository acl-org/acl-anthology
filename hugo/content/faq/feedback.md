We welcome your feedback!
The most convenient way for us to receive it is for you to [create a new issue on our Github issues page](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/issues/).
This is also the method most likely to generate the fastest response, since it can be seen by anyone on the volunteer team.
If you prefer, you are also invited to [email the Anthology director](mailto:anthology@aclweb.org).
