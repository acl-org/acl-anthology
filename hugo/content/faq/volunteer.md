We welcome your contributions!
In fact, since the Anthology is run entirely on volunteer energy, we need them.
The best way to contribute is to browse our [Github issues](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/issues) page (we suggest starting with the ["help wanted"](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) tag, and see what needs to be done that overlaps with your interests or skills.
Please also feel free to email the director, anthology@aclweb.org.
You might also be interested in our [call for volunteers]({{< relref "/info/volunteer.md" >}}).
