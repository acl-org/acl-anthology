The [ACL Anthology Reference Corpus](http://acl-arc.comp.nus.edu.sg/) provides **plain text and other metadata** for a controlled subset of the ACL Anthology.

The following people have written reflections on the ACL Anthology:

+ [Aravind Joshi]({{< relref "reflections-aj.md" >}})
+ [Karen Spärck Jones]({{< relref "reflections-ksj.md" >}})

A 2018 paper gave a technical description of the Anthology at the time:

> [The ACL Anthology: Current State and Future Directions](https://aclweb.org/anthology/W18-2504/)
> Daniel Gildea, Min-Yen Kan, Nitin Madnani, Christoph Teichmann, Martin Villalba
> Proceedings of Workshop for NLP Open Source Software (NLP-OSS)

It is not out of date, but helped direct changes to the Anthology that occurred in 2019.

Many other [publications based on the ACL Anthology](https://scholar.google.de/scholar?q=acl+anthology) exist.
