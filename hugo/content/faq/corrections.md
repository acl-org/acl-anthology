Title: How can I submit corrections to papers?

There are a number of types of corrections. For an overview, you can see our [our corrections page]({{< relref "/info/corrections.md" >}}).

In summary, there are three main types of corrections we handle:

* _Metadata only_. This includes corrections to the title, author list, or abstract. These can be initiated by clicking on the yellow "Fix data" button on any paper page in the Anthology.
* _Author disambiguation_. These corrections involve author pages (e.g., anything under https://aclanthology/people/), and can also be initiated by clicking on the yellow "Fix data" button on any author page. There are two main types of author disambiguation:
   1. _One author, 2+ names_. e.g., [Aravind Joshi](https://aclanthology.org/people/aravind-joshi) Aravind K. Joshi, etc. Note that often, an author will have multiple pages because the metadata for one or more PDFs is incorrect. The pages can be automatically merged if the underlying PDFs have the verbatim string and are simply correct in the metadata. If different names were used, we have to create an entry in our name variants file.
   2. _2+ authors, one name_. e.g., [Yang Liu](https://aclanthology.org/people/yang-liu). In this situation, we have to manually assign IDs to the papers to create a separate author page, typically using their Ph.D. granting institution (e.g., [Yang Liu of Edinburgh](https://aclanthology.org/people/y/yang-liu-edinburgh/).
* _PDF corrections_. This includes changes such as revisions or retractions. For more information, please see see [details on the corrections page]({{< relref "/info/corrections.md" >}}).

Important: The Anthology treats the data on the PDF itself as the authoritative source of information, so all metadata corrections should conform to the information found there. If that information is wrong, a PDF correction is needed.
