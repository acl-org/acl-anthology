Title: How can I submit corrections to papers?

There are a number of types of corrections. For an overview, you can see our [our corrections page]({{< relref "/info/corrections.md" >}}).

In summary, there are four main types of corrections we handle:

* _PDF corrections_. This includes changes such as revisions or retractions. For more information, please see see [details on the corrections page]({{< relref "/info/corrections.md" >}}).
* _Metadata corrections_. This includes corrections to the title, author list, or abstract, for situations where they do not match the PDF. These can be initiated by clicking on the yellow "Fix data" button on any paper page in the Anthology.
* _Author profile merging_. This is required when an author's papers are split over multiple author profiles reflecting different name variants of a single author. Example: [Aravind Joshi](https://aclanthology.org/people/aravind-joshi). After ensuring that all papers have metadata that matches the PDF, Anthology staff can merge profiles under a canonical name variant.
* _Author splitting_. In this situation, multiple different people have published under the same name. To address this, we assign a manual ID to one or more of the authors, based on the author's preferred name and institution of highest (anticipate) degree.

Important: The Anthology treats the data on the PDF itself as the authoritative source of information, so all metadata corrections should conform to the information found there. If that information is wrong, a PDF correction is needed.
