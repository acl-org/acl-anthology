Title: How can I submit corrections to papers?
weight: 1
---

Metadata (title, author list, and abstract) can be corrected by clicking on the yellow "Fix data" button on any paper page in the Anthology (e.g., [K17-1003](https://aclanthology.org/K17-1003/)). This will present you with a modal dialog that upon submission will instantiate an issue template in the Anthology Github repository.

The Anthology treats PDFs as the authoritative source of information, so metadata corrections should conform to the information in the PDF.

For corrections to PDFs, please read the information on [our corrections page]({{< relref "/info/corrections.md" >}}).
