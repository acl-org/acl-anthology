"""
A Python CGI script. Takes the anthology_id parameter, finds the volume,
and then loads that file from ../{volume_id}.bib, which it opens to
search for the appropriate BibTeX entry. This is then printed to STDOUT.

The volume bibtex has lines like the following:

@proceedings{acl-2024-long,
    title = "Proceedings of the 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)",
    editor = "Ku, Lun-Wei  and
      Martins, Andre  and
      Srikumar, Vivek",
    month = aug,
    year = "2024",
    address = "Bangkok, Thailand",
    publisher = "Association for Computational Linguistics",
    url = "https://preview.aclanthology.org/dont-generate-bib-files/2024.acl-long.0/"
}

To find the appropriate entry, walk through the file, reading an entry at a time.
If the entry has a "url" field containing the anthology_id, return that entry.

To test, you can pass the query string in as an environment variable:

    QUERY_STRING="anthology_id=2024.acl-long.1" python generate_bib.cgi

This needs to be done in a sister directory of the volumes/ directory.
