# See here for flags: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/rewrite/flags.html
#
# These rewrite rules attempt to redirect a number of supported URLs
# to the canonical location at https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/. The
# supported URLs are http[s]?://(www.)?anthology.aclweb.org/.
#
# In addition, we support a number of convenience shortcuts for PDF
# files and attachments, paper pages, and authors.

# Notes regarding mirrors:
# we try to keep the rules compatible with mirrors.
# there is one variable we need to fill in:
# ANTHOLOGYDIR is the base directory of the anthology
# and is replaced in this file during build time.

# This is important for returning the proper encoding for BibTeX files
AddDefaultCharset utf-8

# Use the Anthology-themed error document
ErrorDocument 404 ANTHOLOGYDIR/404.html

#
# EXTERNAL REDIRECTIONS
#
# These rules contain external redirections: to HTTPS, to the canonical URLs, and others.
# The redirects are only applicable to the official aclweb.org anthology; all the
# 301 redirects are guarded with a RewriteCond.

# Redirect non-canonical URL bases to https://aclweb.org/anthology/
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^anthology\.aclweb\.org$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.anthology\.aclweb\.org$
RewriteRule ^/?(.*) https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/$1 [R=301,L]

# Now we know we are at the canonical URL.
# Now make sure that we redirect from non-HTTPS to HTTPS.
# **Note**: at this point, paths are relative to /anthology, that is, they *do not include* the /anthology/ text.

## Nested file paths
# Redirect old nested file paths (e.g., P/P17/P17-1069.pdf -> https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1069.pdf)
# Note that since capture patterns can't be reused in the capture portion of the string, this is a leaky match
# that will also redirect X/Z19/P17-1069.pdf -> ANTHOLOGYFILES/pdf/P/P17/P17-1069.pdf

# Redirect nested paper pages to the canonical location (e.g., papers/P/P19/P19-1001/ -> P19-1001)
# This way there is only one page. Should maintain for backward compatibility for some time after August 2019.

# INTERNAL RETRIEVALS
#
# These rules take valid external URLS (which are often virtual targets) and retrieve their target.
# They are invisible to the outside.
