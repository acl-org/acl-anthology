# See here for flags: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/rewrite/flags.html
#
# These rewrite rules attempt to redirect a number of supported URLs
# to the canonical location at https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/. The
# supported URLs are http[s]?://(www.)?anthology.aclweb.org/.
#
# In addition, we support a number of convenience shortcuts for PDF
# files and attachments, paper pages, and authors.

# Notes regarding mirrors:
# we try to keep the rules compatible with mirrors.
# there is one variable we need to fill in:
# ANTHOLOGYDIR is the base directory of the anthology
# and is replaced in this file during build time.

# This is important for returning the proper encoding for BibTeX files
AddDefaultCharset utf-8

# Use the Anthology-themed error document
ErrorDocument 404 /ANTHOLOGYDIR/404.html

RewriteEngine On
# This allows prefixes to work for previews (preview.aclanthology.org/ANTHOLOGYDIR))
RewriteBase /ANTHOLOGYDIR

# EXTERNAL REDIRECTIONS
#
# These rules contain external redirections: to HTTPS, to the canonical URLs, and others.
# The redirects are only applicable to the official aclweb.org anthology; all the
# 301 redirects are guarded with a RewriteCond.

## Nested file paths
