        This form will report paper metadata issues to Anthology staff.
        Each paper's metadata is stored in an [XML](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/tree/master/data/xml)
        record, and is supposed to match what appears in the PDF.
        If you can, submitting a __pull request__ instead of this form will expedite the process
        (please include a link to the paper as a comment in the pull request). Thanks!
