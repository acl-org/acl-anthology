        This form will report issues with author pages. There are two situations: (1) merging and (2) splitting.
        Merging gathers all of an author's papers under a single name, even if they were published under variants
        of the author's name, while splitting allows the separation of papers published under the same
        name but belonging to different people.

      label: Confirming that Paper Metadata is Correct
      description: |
        Anthology policy is that the metadata (i.e., what appears on the web pages) should match what is displayed on the PDF exactly, including any middle names and/or initials of authors.
        If this is not the case, **you must first use the "Fix data" button on each affected paper's page to correct this** (e.g., https://aclanthology.org/1962.earlymt-1.6/) before submitting an author correction.  This form should _only_ be used if there are issues that remain after fixing all the author metadata.
      options:
        - label: I confirm that all affected papers show the exact same names on the website as on the PDF.

        We may need further information to address your problem.
          - If you want to split author pages, **please provide a link to every paper of yours** in the Anthology (third party sites such as Google Scholar are not useful).
          - If you are asking to merge author pages, after ensuring every name matches the PDF, make sure to list which name is the preferred / canonical one.
