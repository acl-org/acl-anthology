        This form will report issues with author pagesâ€”for example, if a name needs to be disambiguated,
        or if two versions of a name should be mapped to the same individual.
        For cases where an individual has published under multiple name variants, submitting a pull request
        that modifies [`name_variants.yaml`](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/blob/master/data/yaml/name_variants.yaml)
        directly will expedite the process. If an author name listed for a paper does not match
        what is in the PDF, instead use the "Fix data" button on the paper page,
        which will help automate the correction. Thanks!

        If an author name listed on the Anthology page does not match the name
        on the PDF, **this is not the correct issue template to use.** Please
        use the "Fix data" button on the affected paper page(s) instead to
        correct the name displayed on the ACL Anthology.

        Please provide as much information as possible to help us fix the issue.  For example:
          - Describe what the correct author page(s) should look like.
          - Provide a link to the academic website of the author(s) that helps us verify their current name or publication list.
          - If there are multiple spellings of the name, indicate which spelling of the name is the preferred/canonical one. _(e.g. if you are submitting a correction for yourself)_
