        Please provide as much information as possible to help us fix the issue.  For example:
          - Describe what the correct author page(s) should look like.
          - Provide a link to the academic website of the author(s) that helps us verify their current name or publication list.
          - If there are multiple spellings of the name, indicate which spelling of the name is the preferred/canonical one. _(e.g. if you are submitting a correction for yourself)_
