## Changes to the author list

You need permission from the relevant conference program chairs if you
want to change the author list in the metadata, see
[the notes on author changes](https://aclanthology.org/info/corrections/#note-on-author-changes)

 - [ ] I have read the note on author changes and will contact the program chairs
       for permission to be posted here or via email.

## Other metadata correction: please describe the issue here**


## Revision or erratum: please add the following information**

- [ ] I have attached the revised PDF or erratum to this issue
- [ ] I have written a brief description of the changes below

The brief description of the changes will be displayed on your paper page, and should be written in a neutral (third-person) fashion with complete sentences. For example:

> This revision corrects a typo in Equation 7. It also introduces a new figure, Figure 12, which plots the relationship between our proposed model and the baselines.
