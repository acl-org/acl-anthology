        **Please do not edit the JSON below.** This form is not meant to be used manually; instead, it is activated by clicking the yellow "Fix data" button found on each paper page in the Anthology (e.g., https://aclanthology.org/K17-1003/). Doing so displays a UI tool for modifying the title, abstract, and author list. Submission of that form will automatically populate the title above and data block below.
