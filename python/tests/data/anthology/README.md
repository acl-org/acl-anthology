This directory contains data files similar to the [actual data
files](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/blob/master/data/) of the
Anthology, in order to serve as a basis for writing test cases for the Python
library.  Importantly, while these data files were instantiated with actual
information from real journals and proceedings, **they may contain fabricated or
otherwise modified information** to suit the test cases that we want to test.
Therefore, they shouldn't be considered as factually correct, and should
generally **not** be overwritten with the latest "actual" data files.

These files are copyright by the ACL and covered by the [Apache-2.0
