    Info:
        The connection between persons and Anthology items is derived from [name specifications][acl_anthology.people.name.NameSpecification] on volumes and papers, and not stored explicitly. This means that Person objects **cannot be used to make changes to paper metadata**, e.g. which person a paper is associated with or under which name; change the information on papers instead.

        Person objects **can** be used to make changes to metadata that appears in `people.yaml`, such as ORCID, comment, degree, and alternative names for this person.

    Attributes:
        id: A unique ID for this person.
        parent: The parent Anthology instance to which this person belongs.
        item_ids: A list of volume and/or paper IDs this person has authored or edited.
        orcid: The person's ORCID.
        comment: A comment for disambiguation purposes.
        degree: The person's institution of highest degree, for disambiguation purposes.
        similar_ids: A list of person IDs with names that should be considered similar to this one.  Do **not** use this to _find_ people with similar names; that should be done via [`PersonIndex.similar`][acl_anthology.people.index.PersonIndex].  This attribute can be used to explicitly add more "similar IDs" that are not automatically derived via similar names.
        disable_name_matching: If True, no items should be assigned to this person unless they explicitly specify this person's ID.
        is_explicit: If True, this person's ID is explicitly defined in `people.yaml`.  You probably want to use [`make_explicit()`][acl_anthology.people.person.Person.make_explicit] rather than change this attribute.
