class EventIndex:

    Keeps track of all events in the anthology and their relation to venues and volumes.
    Events are both explicitly represented in a collections <event> block, and are also
    implicit: every volume has one or more <venue> tags, as well as a year, and this information
    is used to add each volume to its event. For example, if a volume in year YYYY is
    has <venue>X</venue>, it will appear in the event named X-YYYY.

    This still leaves some events semi-implicit, since they are not listed explicitly in
    the <event> block. We may wish to change this in the future.
