"""Used to add attachments to the Anthology.
Usage:

    add_attachment_bulk.py CSV_FILE

Where CSV_FILE is output from the Microsoft form (https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAMAABqTSThUN0I2VEdZMTk4Sks3S042MVkxUEZQUVdOUS4u) we use to collect attachments, and has the following headers:

    ID,Start time,Completion time,Email,Name,Anthology ID,URL where we can download the attachment,Attachment type,"For corrections or errata, please explain in detailed prose what has changed.",Your name,Your email address,I agree to the Anthology's CC-BY-4.0 distribution license.

Downloads the files, edits the XML, and dumps a log to
add_attachments.log, along with emails to be sent to those whose
imports failed.
