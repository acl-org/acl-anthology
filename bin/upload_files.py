"""
Uploads PDFs and other files to their correct place on aclweb.org.

Usage:

  [not yet implemented]
  upload_files.py [directory]

will upload all files in the directory to the correct place on the server,
under the assumption they all go to the same folder.

  upload_files.py [file1 [file2 [etc]]]

will upload individual files to their correct place on the server,
where each file may have a different target directory.
